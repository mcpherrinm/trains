Monorail specifications
-----------------------

The track is made from 5/8" (todo: confirm this is what I was using) MDF (or
whatever).

The track is nominally 74 mm wide, up to 75mm and down to 72mm.  Trains should
be designed to allow straight 78mm track, and to run on 70mm.  (Todo: Evaluate
safety margins)


On top of the track, at least 50mm of clearance from the top surface.  Beside
the outside of the track, the same? (Todo: measure current prototype and
increase 1.5x). Until todo, assume 1 track width, ie, 74mm.  non-powered stock
must allow half that clearance, for denser storage tracks.  Power can then only
access one of the adjacent sidings.  That shouldn't be an issue, but that
constraint ought to be added to control software.

Turnouts:
Several possible designs.  A single moving piece that swings between two
tracks.  Two swinging pieces on each branch, connected by a linkage. I think
the two-piece design could get nicer joins, but that's just guessing.
More details after some prototypes are built.

Initially, track is minimally graded, but finalized designs will allow for
grade testing.  At least 50% of the flat speed should be obtainable.  (but
really, as long as it doesn't slip).  Grades could have surface coatings for
additional traction -- MDF isn't the best surface.  Hockey tape?

Power options are still being evaluated.  Initially, trains are being tethered
to power.  Battery power in stage 2, and then some hybrid online charging
solution.
